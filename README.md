# PasswordGenerator

## Description
This project was made in order to assist in creating passwords of varying criteria and strength. This solves the problem of having to create a strong password based on certain criteria by doing it automatically for the user. From this project I learned much about the use of arrays, for loops, and generating random numbers. I also gained deeper insight into the logic behind programs and the role it plays during the development process.

## Usage
This project can be used to generate passwords with varying criteria. It can also be used to reivew and/or learn how arrays, loops, and random number generators can be used together. These operations can be combined and applied to more than just password generators, but this projects serves as a good example and demonstration on how they can be used.
